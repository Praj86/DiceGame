## How It Works

- Each time the "Re-Roll" button is clicked, both dice roll randomly.
- Random numbers (1 to 6) determine the dice images displayed for each player.
- The winner is displayed at the top based on the higher roll. If both rolls are equal, it displays "Draw!".

## Code Overview

- **`randomDice()` function**: Generates a random number between 1 and 6.
- **`randomDiceImage()` function**: Updates the dice images based on random numbers and displays the winner or if itâ€™s a draw.
- **Event Listener for "Re-Roll" Button**: Calls `randomDiceImage()` to re-roll the dice.

## Customization

- Modify the images in the `/images` folder if you'd like different dice faces.
- Adjust colors or styles in `styles.css` to personalize the game's appearance.
